# About Repository

Creating gui application with golang something nightmare before sometime[ until i found sciter sdk wrapper for Golang] for me.  There is very less amount of resource available for go-sciter. So I am sharing this examples to give some contribution to create resource.

## About Programs

No one is perfect in this world, so how one can create perfect things. Program written by me may be written in some another[ far better ] way. If you found something like that please make a pull request. I will be happy to review and merge it.
I have explained almost all program listed below on my blog  [ link to my blog ](https://www.mchampaneri.in)

## List of programs

#### [06-BuiltinHTML](https://www.mchampaneri.in/2018/07/embed-gui-inside-your-go-code.html)
It's not good if you have to load external html file. As you have to care about location of html file. But instead what if html is inside your gocode? . It's cool right!. This is examples is about how to embedded html in your go code.

#### [07-notepadScratch](https://www.mchampaneri.in/2018/07/simple-documnet-based-appliaction-with.html)
Time to explore something new. This example contains code for extremely simple notepad. It just allows you to open file, write a new file , save it and exit the appliaction. But, Its a good example for those who want to make an application has to work with documents, right! of course.

#### [08-packfolderIntro](https://www.mchampaneri.in/2018/08/use-packfolder-to-archive-your-resource.html)
If you have gone through 06, it actully puts html/css code in go file. Which looks weird. Sciter-sdk comes with one utility called packfolder which can generate single archive for your resource folder in one of the supported output format. So, now there is no need to write your gui inside go code. You can use packfolder to use that code. 

If you are confused what i am talking about, please see the code, it might make you more clear.
